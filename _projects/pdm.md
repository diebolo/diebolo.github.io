For the final assignment of the course planning and decision making, we were tasked with taking an existing research paper and implementing their planning method on a simulated robot. We chose a quadcopter as our robot and [RRT-u](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1279130/FULLTEXT02), by Urban Eriksson, as the planning method.

The final report is shown below. Alternatively you can download it [here](/assets/pdf/PDM_project.pdf) and view the code [here](https://github.com/WisterianTK/PDM_Project)
