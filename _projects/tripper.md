For the course Software Engineering Methods from my Computer Science minor we had to develop a software solution. We came up with a service that automatically planned in your travel time for you. By setting the location of the event in your Google Calendar, Tripper would block your travelling time, which was calculated with a Google API, in your calendar and supply you with a navigation link.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/sem/event.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/sem/overview.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/sem/tripper-event.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>
