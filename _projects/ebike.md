For my high school end project I wanted to make something useful and fun. I had my eyes on a faster transportation method and thus chose to make my own e-bike on a budget. This meant making the battery myself, collecting old laptop batteries from over 20 PC shops. I extracted the cells and discharge tested them one by one. I made my own welder from an old transformer and an arduino and spotwelded the batteries together.

        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/ebike/e3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>

I also needed a case to hold the batteries. I made my own CAD model and through a connection I got in contact with a big metal company who could make a one off powder coated aluminium case. I ordered a 2kW in-wheel motor from Alibaba and found a still in good condition sport/city bike where the backwheel had been crushed by a collision.

        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/ebike/e4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>


I replaced the backwheel with the motor wheel and mounted the case. The e-bike is still running after 5 years.
