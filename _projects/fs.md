I was working at the time for Fietsenwinkel Schoorl, which sells high-end bikes. They wanted a webshop and had all the components to build one, except for a link to the inventory system of the store to its webshop. I had some free time and thus made <a href="https://fietsenwinkelschoorl.nl/winkel">this link and the webshop.</a>
